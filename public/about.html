<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 25 year old developer. I have a passion for data science and mathematics, and my day job is an AI
  consultant. I have a passion for teaching.

<p>When I'm off the computer, one of my favorite things to do is travel. My next big trip is to Colombia! I 
  also work out, watch movies and concerts, and play poker with friends. For a tech guy, I'm a bit old fashioned in 
that I read the paper newspaper. I wind down by meditating, reading non-fiction, and on occasion building legos.</p>
